## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Module context

The runtime SHALL call each module's `start` with a context that gives the module:
- its own participant on the one shared bus, with source `bunny/modules/<name>`, including `publishMessage`;
- a logger whose records have the one module scope, `bunny.module`, carry the module's name in the attribute `bunny.module`, and carry the trace ID, span ID and flags of a given trace context;
- tracing that starts a span in a given parent's trace, or a new trace without one;
- the runtime's clock and a scheduler on the runtime's scheduler, which also run the bus's `time`, `expiresat` and request deadlines;
- worker threads that the runtime terminates when the module stops;
- the module's own SQLite file, `modules/<name>.sqlite` in the runtime's private state directory, opened with `node:sqlite` on first use, mode 600, and kept across restarts;
- an abort signal that aborts when the module stops.

A scheduler delay SHALL be an integer from 0 to 2147483647; any other SHALL throw `RangeError`. Once the module's stop begins, its participant, scheduler, workers and database SHALL refuse use with `invalid-state`, while its logger, tracing, clock and signal SHALL keep working, so that its `stop` can still log. Log records SHALL be diagnostic-contract records, as "Diagnostic-contract log records" requires, at `info` and above by default.

#### Scenario: Log records name the module and the trace
- **WHEN** a module logs at each level with fields and a span from `trace.span(parent)`
- **THEN** the debug record is dropped at the default level, the others carry their severity, the scope `bunny.module` and the `bunny.module` attribute, which the module's fields cannot replace, as `bunny.provenance` cannot be replaced either, and the record with the span carries the parent's trace ID and the span's own span ID

#### Scenario: Deadlines follow the runtime's clock
- **WHEN** the runtime runs on an injected clock and scheduler and a module requests with a 1000 ms timeout from a blocked responder
- **THEN** the command's `time` and `expiresat` come from that clock, the request stays pending while real time passes, and it resolves as `uncertain` when the injected scheduler reaches the deadline; the module's timers fire and cancel on the same scheduler

#### Scenario: The module's own database
- **WHEN** a module writes to its database, the runtime stops, and a runtime on the same state directory starts the module again
- **THEN** the file is `modules/<name>.sqlite` with mode 600 in a mode 700 directory, the second start reads the row, and a module that never asks has no file

#### Scenario: A worker thread
- **WHEN** a module starts a worker thread and messages it
- **THEN** the worker answers

#### Scenario: A prepared message
- **WHEN** a module publishes a message and then publishes the same message again with `publishMessage`
- **THEN** another module receives it twice, the same message with its `id` and `time`

### Requirement: Failure isolation

A module's thrown error, rejected promise or device timeout SHALL stop only that module, and health SHALL show it `failed`. This covers a start that throws, rejects or outlasts the start deadline; a subscription handler or responder that throws; a scheduled callback that throws or rejects; an uncaught error in the module's worker thread; and an error that escapes to the process from the module's own async flow. A refusal or failure SHALL be logged with the module, its 2.0 registry code in `bunny.code`, where it arose in `bunny.phase` (`manifest`, `start`, `handler`, `timer`, `worker`, `async`, or `handlers` and `stop` for the two bounded steps of a stop), the error's type and, when it is an identifier, its code; as the diagnostic contract requires, a record SHALL NOT hold the reason's sentence, the raw message or the stack. A refusal of a malformed name SHALL leave the name out. A dropped delivery SHALL NOT fail its module: a subscription's first drop SHALL be logged at once, then the drops that go on SHALL be logged once a minute with their count, and a minute without drops SHALL end that, so that the next drop is logged at once.

To stop a module, the runtime SHALL abort its signal, cancel its timers and close its participant, which settles the module's own pending requests, closes its sync copies and owners and waits only for its own running handlers; then it SHALL call the module's `stop` once, terminate its workers and close its database. The participant's close and `stop` SHALL each be bounded by the stop deadline, so `stop` runs after a close that timed out while a hung handler may still run. The whole stop SHALL run in the module's own async flow, whichever flow noticed the failure, so that an error its abort listeners or cleanup throw or reject belongs to that module. A module's stop SHALL NOT wait on another module's handler. The other modules SHALL keep working. An error that escapes to the process from code outside every module SHALL be logged as `runtime.failed` and SHALL exit the process with status 1.

#### Scenario: A handler throws
- **WHEN** a module's subscription handler throws
- **THEN** health shows it `failed` with `internal` and "a handler threw", its record carries `bunny.code` `internal` and `bunny.phase` `handler`, its stop runs once, its subscription receives nothing more, a request to its responder is `unavailable`, and another module still answers requests

#### Scenario: A start fails or times out
- **WHEN** one module's start rejects, another's throws and a third's never finishes, as when its device never answers
- **THEN** the first two are `failed` with "start failed", the third is `failed` with `unavailable` after the start deadline, each is stopped, and another module runs

#### Scenario: A scheduled device call times out
- **WHEN** a module's scheduled callback rejects with a `TimeoutError`
- **THEN** the module is `failed` with "a scheduled callback failed", and the log names the `TimeoutError`

#### Scenario: A worker or an escaped error
- **WHEN** a module's worker thread throws, or an error escapes from a continuation the module started
- **THEN** that module is `failed`, and an error raised outside every module is not attributed to any module

#### Scenario: Errors escape a running process
- **WHEN** in a runtime process one module throws from its own timer and another leaves a rejected promise unhandled
- **THEN** both are `failed` with "an error escaped the module", a third module keeps running, health keeps answering, and SIGTERM still exits 0

#### Scenario: The runtime's own error
- **WHEN** an error escapes to the process from code outside every module
- **THEN** the process writes a fatal `runtime.failed` record with the error's type and code, without its message, and exits with status 1

#### Scenario: No raw error message in the log
- **WHEN** a module's responder throws an error with a code whose message quotes a URL with a token
- **THEN** the failure record carries the error's type and code, and no record holds the token

#### Scenario: Abort listeners that fail
- **WHEN** modules whose abort listeners throw, or leave a rejected promise unhandled, are stopped after a handler error, after a failed start and by the runtime's stop
- **THEN** each error stays with its own module, the module that published the failing handler's message keeps running, no `runtime.failed` record is written and SIGTERM exits 0

#### Scenario: Dropped deliveries
- **WHEN** 1100 messages reach a subscription whose handler is stalled, ten more drop in the second minute, the third minute is quiet, and one more drops after it
- **THEN** one `runtime.delivery.dropped` record is written at once with a count of one, one at the first minute's end with the later drops, the ten wait for one record at the second minute's end, the quiet minute writes nothing, the drop after it is logged at once, every message is either delivered or counted, and the module keeps running

#### Scenario: A sync begun in a failed start
- **WHEN** a module begins a sync of ten families and its start then throws
- **THEN** once the module has stopped, a burst on every family queues nothing for it and no drop is logged

#### Scenario: Stop never waits on another module
- **WHEN** a module fails while its own handler awaits a request to another module whose responder is blocked
- **THEN** that request resolves as `uncertain`, the failed module's stop runs while the other responder is still blocked, and the other module stays running

#### Scenario: A handler that never finishes
- **WHEN** the runtime stops while a module's own handler never finishes
- **THEN** the stop completes within the stop deadline, the module is `stopped`, its `stop` ran once and the timeout is logged

#### Scenario: Nothing left behind
- **WHEN** a module with a pending timer, an open database and a worker thread fails
- **THEN** its signal is aborted, no timer of the module or of the runtime's deadlines remains, the timer never fires, its database is closed, its worker exits, its participant refuses calls, its context refuses timers, workers and the database with `invalid-state`, and its logger, tracing and clock still work

### Requirement: Event-loop lag check

The runtime process SHALL detect an event loop that stays stuck for the lag limit, 10 s by default, and SHALL make the service manager restart the whole runtime: a watchdog thread SHALL write a fatal `runtime.stuck` record with the runtime's resource to stderr and kill the process with SIGKILL, which a systemd unit with `Restart=on-failure` restarts. The thread SHALL load the diagnostic contract's pure entry point but never the SDK, and SHALL kill the process even when it cannot write the record. A busy spell shorter than the limit SHALL NOT stop the process. Time in which the watchdog itself did not run, because its wait overran, SHALL NOT count, so a pause of the whole process SHALL NOT restart it; a main thread still stuck SHALL be caught once the watchdog has been awake for the limit. A watchdog thread that ends without being asked SHALL be logged, and health SHALL then show the lag check `stopped` and the runtime `degraded`.

#### Scenario: A stuck event loop
- **WHEN** a module's code blocks the event loop for good, with a lag limit of 300 ms
- **THEN** health answered before the block, the process is killed with SIGKILL within seconds, and stderr holds a fatal `runtime.stuck` record naming the limit, which passes the contract's validator and carries the same resource as the process's `runtime.started`

#### Scenario: A paused process
- **WHEN** the watchdog's wait overruns by 3 s because the whole process was paused, and it checks before the main thread's next beat
- **THEN** the paused time is not counted and the process is not killed; when the process is stopped with SIGSTOP for 3 s and continued, it keeps serving health

#### Scenario: Stuck through a pause
- **WHEN** the main thread stays stuck before and after a 10 s pause
- **THEN** the watchdog counts only the time it was awake, and still reaches the limit

#### Scenario: A watchdog that stops
- **WHEN** the watchdog thread ends without being asked
- **THEN** a `runtime.watchdog.stopped` error record names its exit code, health shows the lag check `stopped` with its limit and the runtime `degraded`; a runtime without a lag check shows it `off`, and one stopped on purpose logs nothing

#### Scenario: A short busy spell
- **WHEN** a module blocks the event loop for 150 ms with a lag limit of 1000 ms
- **THEN** the process keeps serving health and exits 0 on SIGTERM, with no `runtime.stuck` record

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Diagnostic-contract log records

Every record the runtime writes SHALL be a diagnostic-contract record (`docs/observability-contract.md`) of profile 1.2, built by the contract's `createRecord`, written by default as one JSON line on stderr: `schema_version` `1.2`, the timestamp, the severity pair, a registered event with its static body, the resource, the scope with version `1.0.0`, `bunny.provenance` `source` and only registered attributes. The resource SHALL be service `runtime` in namespace `bunny`, `service.version` the runtime package's version, a neutral `service.instance.id` that the process draws once and that every writer in it and the watchdog thread share, and `deployment.environment.name`, `development` unless the process's `--environment` argument names `test` or `production`. The runtime's own records SHALL have scope `bunny.runtime`, and a module's SHALL have scope `bunny.module`. The contract SHALL refuse, and the runtime SHALL drop whole and count, a record with an unregistered event, an event outside its scope or a value outside its registered type; attributes the catalog does not register SHALL be left out. A module SHALL log only the events the catalog registers for `bunny.module`. A sink that throws SHALL lose only its record, and a closed stderr SHALL be ignored, so that neither changes what the runtime or its modules do. The stdout ready line SHALL stay `{"event":"runtime.ready","url":...}`.

#### Scenario: Every record passes the contract's validator
- **WHEN** the runtime and its fixture modules run in the runtime's tests, in the in-memory harness on both transports, and as processes
- **THEN** every record they write passes the contract's validator as its JSON line, every stderr line of a shipped process does too, and each process's records share one instance ID that another process does not

#### Scenario: A module's record the contract refuses
- **WHEN** a module logs an unregistered event, one of the runtime's own events, a field the catalog does not register holding a raw message, or a URL in a registered attribute
- **THEN** no record holds the event or the message, the unregistered field is left out of the record that is written, the record with the URL is not written, and the writer counts each record it dropped

#### Scenario: A failing sink
- **WHEN** the sink throws on every record, or the process's stderr is closed
- **THEN** the modules start, answer requests and stop, health answers `ok`, and SIGTERM exits 0

#### Scenario: Maintenance intake reads the runtime's journal
- **WHEN** the stderr lines of a clean run and of a start refused for a relative state directory become synthetic journald rows that intake reads for service `runtime`
- **THEN** intake accepts every line and turns the `runtime.failed` record into a finding, refuses a record in the #880 format or labeled profile 1.1, and accepts none while its configuration names only `hub`
