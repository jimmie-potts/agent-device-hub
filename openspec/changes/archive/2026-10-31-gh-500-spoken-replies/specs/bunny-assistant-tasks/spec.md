## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Spoken replies to typed requests

When a task turn ends with a result, a question for the owner or a refusal, the companions module SHALL offer that saved message once to its speech coordinator, after the message is durable, under the message's own identity. A `speak` control naming a task and a saved assistant message SHALL offer that message again under the request's identity; it SHALL refuse owner or tool text and an unknown message, SHALL work for finished tasks, and SHALL be idempotent per request. A message longer than 512 characters SHALL stay written only. Startup reconciliation SHALL offer nothing, and a failed offer SHALL NOT change the task's outcome. The spoken voice SHALL be the installation's qualified local voice regardless of the model provider, and stopping speech SHALL NOT answer a question or cancel the task.

#### Scenario: Turn-ending messages are spoken once
- **WHEN** spoken replies are enabled and a typed request produces a question, then an answer produces a result
- **THEN** the question and the result are each spoken once through the reserved endpoint with the saved text, and a restart between them speaks nothing

#### Scenario: Speak replays a saved answer
- **WHEN** the owner activates Speak beside a saved assistant message
- **THEN** one accepted control receipt is recorded, the message is spoken again as its own utterance, a repeated request id speaks nothing more, and Speak on owner text or an unknown message is refused

#### Scenario: Stop without cancellation
- **WHEN** the owner stops speech while a question is being spoken
- **THEN** the audio stops, the task stays waiting for its answer, and Quiet mode keeps the next reply written only

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Accessible conversation panel

The dashboard SHALL present the B.U.N.N.Y. conversation on the companions `assistant` page: the provider and model, allowed and unavailable tools, usage in tokens or unknown, the saved conversation with owner, assistant and tool messages, and explicit send, answer, approve, decline, resume and cancel controls. It SHALL carry the speech endpoint controls as spoken replies (enable in this tab, mute, stop speaking, playback and tracked operation) and a Speak control beside each saved assistant message within the spoken bound, stating that enabling makes the tab the one speaker and that stopping speech does not cancel the task. It SHALL label the synthetic provider as making no paid calls, preserve written context and saved questions on reload, and distinguish control receipts from task state. Disconnection SHALL be visible and prevent mutation against stale state. Assistant activation SHALL default off without affecting fixed-text Reachy or coding-session lifecycle ownership.

#### Scenario: Approval by keyboard
- **WHEN** a task waits for approval and the owner reloads the page and operates it by keyboard
- **THEN** the proposal, its target and value are readable, approve and decline have accessible names, and a successful answer receipt does not assert that the command completed

#### Scenario: Read-only and disconnected states
- **WHEN** the browser lacks control authority or loses its connection
- **THEN** saved history stays readable, every mutating control is disabled, and the page says why

#### Scenario: Spoken replies by keyboard
- **WHEN** the owner enables spoken replies in the Conversation tab by keyboard, sends a request and activates Speak on the saved answer
- **THEN** the question, result and replay are spoken through that tab, the Speak receipt is shown apart from the playback report, and the page passes the accessibility checks
