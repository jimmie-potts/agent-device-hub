## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Fixture module

The runtime's tests SHALL hold a fixture module, a simulated lamp that later stories use as their stand-in device module, a consume-only fixture chime, and a stand-in core. A module that reaches a device SHALL be created by a factory that takes the device's transport, `create<Name>Module({transport})`, with no manifest slot or registry for transports; the lamp (`createLampModule`) and the chime (`createChimeModule`) SHALL show the convention with simulated transports that keep their state when the runtime restarts.

The lamp SHALL serve its lamps through sync, copy the core's mode and sessions, switch a lamp on command, refuse an unknown lamp with `not-found` and switching on in quiet mode with `invalid-state`, and report each switch through its outbox: the lamp's state, an occurrence and the outcome. It SHALL accept a command whose `requestId` it already handled from the same source without acting or reporting again. When its lamp cannot be reached, its outcome SHALL be `failed`, with evidence `none` and the `unavailable` error. Its indicator SHALL show whether a session waits for a person. The chime SHALL ring once for each approval prompt in the sessions it copies. Both SHALL pass the module test kit.

The stand-in core SHALL serve the mode, take every occurrence and outcome once by `(source, id)`, keeping what it took in its own SQLite file across restarts, and acknowledge each outcome with the kit's stand-in acknowledgment, which the lamp SHALL follow before it republishes. Until Hub #831 and #782 replace it, it SHALL also commit each hook's `lifecycle` observation to the session record, record each outcome as a `stand-in-history` entry and each failed or uncertain one as an `inbox-item` operation, in one transaction with what it took, and serve the session, inbox and history families through sync.

#### Scenario: The lamp passes the kit
- **WHEN** the runtime's tests run the module test kit on the lamp and on the chime
- **THEN** every check passes

#### Scenario: Under the runtime
- **WHEN** the runtime hosts the stand-in core, the lamp and a requester, and the requester switches a lamp on
- **THEN** the request is accepted and the core takes the outcome once; in quiet mode the request is refused with `invalid-state`

#### Scenario: A kill between commit and publish
- **WHEN** the runtime process is killed after the lamp commits a switch and before it publishes anything, then started twice on the same state directory without the requester
- **THEN** at the first restart the lamp sends its state, occurrence and outcome, the core takes the outcome exactly once and acknowledges it, and the lamp forgets it; the second restart sends nothing; and the lamp never receives the command again

#### Scenario: A duplicate command
- **WHEN** a requester sends a lamp command again with the `requestId` the lamp already handled
- **THEN** the lamp accepts it, the device switches once and the core's history holds one outcome for it

#### Scenario: A lamp that cannot be reached
- **WHEN** the lamp's device fails a switch
- **THEN** the command is accepted, the outcome is `failed` with evidence `none`, and the core holds it in history and as a failed inbox operation

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Scenario catalog and in-memory harness

The runtime's tests SHALL keep one scenario catalog of seeds and named steps: actions, expectations within a time bound and observations that hold for a while. A seed SHALL name the modules to start, built by their factories with simulated transports, and the families a reader copies. Every execution adapter SHALL run the same definitions unchanged; a scenario SHALL touch the runtime only through the harness contract, and a transport-specific expectation SHALL be data in the scenario. A failed step SHALL name what it observed and stop the scenario.

The in-memory harness (tier 1) SHALL host a seed's modules in the runtime's module host, on a manual clock and scheduler that also drive the bus, the edge and every remote client. It SHALL run each scenario twice: with the scenario's parts on the host's bus, and with them reaching it through a `RemoteEdge` on 127.0.0.1 with a run-generated token per part. It SHALL be able to crash the runtime between the lamp's commit and its publish and start it again on the same state directory and edge port, and to disconnect a part. It SHALL never listen on an installed service's port (8765, 8787, 8788, 8791 or 41231), SHALL keep its state in a private directory outside every Git checkout, which it removes afterwards, SHALL keep its tokens out of every log record and message, and SHALL check every message it sees against profile 2.0. `npm run test:runtime:scenarios` SHALL run the catalog, and the core CI job SHALL run its `:built` variant after its fresh build.

The catalog SHALL cover an approval prompt reaching every module, a command with a tracked outcome, a module failing while the others continue, a part reconnecting and syncing, the runtime starting with zero modules, and the early end-to-end path: a hook observation, the committed session, the simulated device's update, a command, its outcome, history and inbox rows, then sync and read, with a duplicate command, the deadline answers, a disconnect and a crash-restart. The deadline answers SHALL follow the SDK's conformance requirement on both transports: a command its handler holds at the deadline is `uncertain-result`, and one still queued is `expired`; a requester that closes while its command is queued gets `cancelled` in process and `uncertain-result` remotely; and a remote requester whose command is in flight when the runtime crashes gets `uncertain-result`.

#### Scenario: Tier 1 in CI
- **WHEN** `npm run test:runtime:scenarios` runs
- **THEN** every catalog scenario passes in process and through the edge, every part reached the runtime through the edge in the remote run, and no message broke profile 2.0

#### Scenario: A duplicate, a disconnect and a crash on both transports
- **WHEN** the end-to-end scenario sends a command twice with one `requestId`, disconnects the reader while the lamp switches, and crashes the runtime between the lamp's commit and its publish
- **THEN** history holds one outcome for the duplicate and the device switched once; the reader syncs again and hears nothing published while it was away; at the restart the lamp republishes its state, occurrence and outcome once, history takes the outcome once, the lamp receives no command, and a clean restart republishes nothing

#### Scenario: A failed step
- **WHEN** an expectation never holds, an action throws or a held observation breaks
- **THEN** the scenario fails at that step with what it observed, and runs no later step

#### Scenario: Boundaries
- **WHEN** a harness starts
- **THEN** its edge listens on 127.0.0.1 on a port outside the installed services' ports, its state directory is mode 700 and removed afterwards, a state directory inside a Git checkout is refused with `state-dir-checkout`, and its tokens are unique and appear in no log record, edge record or message
