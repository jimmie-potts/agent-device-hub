## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Fixture module

The runtime's tests SHALL hold a fixture module, a simulated lamp that later stories use as their stand-in device module, a consume-only fixture chime, and a stand-in core. A module that reaches a device SHALL be created by a factory that takes the device's transport, `create<Name>Module({transport})`, with no manifest slot or registry for transports; the lamp (`createLampModule`) and the chime (`createChimeModule`) SHALL show the convention with simulated transports that keep their state when the runtime restarts.

The lamp SHALL serve its lamps through sync, copy the core's mode and sessions, switch a lamp on command, refuse an unknown lamp with `not-found` and switching on in quiet mode with `invalid-state`, and report each switch through its outbox: the lamp's state, an occurrence and the outcome. It SHALL accept a command whose `requestId` it already handled from the same source without acting or reporting again. When its lamp cannot be reached, its outcome SHALL be `failed`, with evidence `none` and the `unavailable` error. Its indicator SHALL show whether a session waits for a person. The chime SHALL ring once for each approval prompt in the sessions it copies, keeping what it rang in its own SQLite file across restarts. Both SHALL pass the module test kit.

The stand-in core SHALL serve the mode, take every occurrence and outcome once by `(source, id)`, keeping what it took in its own SQLite file across restarts, and acknowledge each outcome with the kit's stand-in acknowledgment, which the lamp SHALL follow before it republishes. It SHALL also stand in for three parts of the core, each until its owner lands: the session owner until Hub #831, committing each hook's `lifecycle` observation to the session record; history until Hub #782, recording each outcome as a `stand-in-history` entry; and the inbox items until Hub #923, recording each failed or uncertain outcome as an `inbox-item` operation. It SHALL commit these in one transaction with what it took, and serve the session, inbox and history families through sync.

#### Scenario: The lamp passes the kit
- **WHEN** the runtime's tests run the module test kit on the lamp and on the chime
- **THEN** every check passes

#### Scenario: Under the runtime
- **WHEN** the runtime hosts the stand-in core, the lamp and a requester, and the requester switches a lamp on
- **THEN** the request is accepted and the core takes the outcome once; in quiet mode the request is refused with `invalid-state`

#### Scenario: A kill between commit and publish
- **WHEN** the runtime process is killed after the lamp commits a switch and before it publishes anything, then started twice on the same state directory without the requester
- **THEN** at the first restart the lamp sends its state, occurrence and outcome, the core takes the outcome exactly once and acknowledges it, and the lamp forgets it; the second restart sends nothing; and the lamp never receives the command again

#### Scenario: A duplicate command
- **WHEN** a requester sends a lamp command again with the `requestId` the lamp already handled
- **THEN** the lamp accepts it, the device switches once and the core's history holds one outcome for it

#### Scenario: A lamp that cannot be reached
- **WHEN** the lamp's device fails a switch
- **THEN** the command is accepted, the outcome is `failed` with evidence `none`, and the core holds it in history and as a failed inbox operation

#### Scenario: A chime restart
- **WHEN** the runtime restarts while an approval prompt the chime rang for still waits
- **THEN** the chime does not ring for it again

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Scenario catalog and in-memory harness

The runtime's tests SHALL keep one scenario catalog of seeds and named steps: actions, expectations within a time bound and observations that hold for a while. A seed SHALL name the modules to start, built by their factories with simulated transports, and the families a reader copies. Every execution adapter SHALL run the same definitions unchanged; a scenario SHALL touch the runtime only through the harness contract, and a transport-specific expectation SHALL be data in the scenario. A failed step SHALL name what it observed and stop the scenario.

The in-memory harness (tier 1) SHALL host a seed's modules in the runtime's module host, on a manual clock and scheduler that also drive the bus, the edge and every remote client. It SHALL run each scenario twice: with the scenario's parts on the host's bus, and with them reaching it through a `RemoteEdge` on 127.0.0.1 with a run-generated token per part. It SHALL be able to crash the runtime between the lamp's commit and its publish and start it again on the same state directory and edge port, to disconnect a part, and to lose the core's next acknowledgment to the lamp on its way. It SHALL never listen on an installed service's port (8765, 8787, 8788, 8791 or 41231), SHALL keep its state in a private directory outside every Git checkout, which it removes afterwards, SHALL keep its tokens out of every log record and message, and SHALL check every message it sees against profile 2.0. `npm run test:runtime:scenarios` SHALL run the catalog, and the core CI job SHALL run its `:built` variant after its fresh build.

The catalog SHALL cover an approval prompt reaching every module, a command with a tracked outcome, a module failing while the others continue, a part reconnecting and syncing, the runtime starting with zero modules, and the early end-to-end path: a hook observation, the committed session, the simulated device's update, a command, its outcome, history and inbox rows, then sync and read, with a duplicate command, a failed command whose inbox row the reader reads, the deadline answers, a disconnect, a crash-restart and a lost acknowledgment. The deadline answers SHALL follow the SDK on both transports: a command its handler holds at the deadline is `uncertain-result`, and one still queued is `expired`, as `bunny-sdk` "Request and respond with expiry" requires; a requester that closes while its command is queued gets `cancelled` in process and `uncertain-result` remotely, as "One conformance suite for every transport" fixes per transport. A remote requester whose command is in flight when the runtime crashes SHALL get `uncertain-result`, as the remote client settles a call whose connection drops, by the command's deadline plus `REQUESTER_GRACE_MS` at the latest. An in-process requester dies with the runtime; the harness labels its request `lost`, which is not an SDK answer.

#### Scenario: Tier 1 in CI
- **WHEN** `npm run test:runtime:scenarios` runs
- **THEN** every catalog scenario passes in process and through the edge, every part reached the runtime through the edge in the remote run, and no message broke profile 2.0

#### Scenario: A duplicate, a disconnect and a crash on both transports
- **WHEN** the end-to-end scenario sends a command twice with one `requestId`, sends one the lamp cannot carry out, disconnects the reader while the lamp switches, crashes the runtime between the lamp's commit and its publish, and loses the core's acknowledgment of a later outcome
- **THEN** history holds one outcome for the duplicate and the device switched once; the failed command's inbox row reaches the reader and survives the restart; the reader syncs again and hears nothing published while it was away; at the restart the lamp republishes its state, occurrence and outcome once, history takes the outcome once and the lamp receives no command; an outcome whose acknowledgment was lost goes out again at the next clean restart, the core takes it as a duplicate, acknowledges it again and keeps one history entry, and the restart after that republishes nothing

#### Scenario: A failed step
- **WHEN** an expectation never holds, an action throws or a held observation breaks
- **THEN** the scenario fails at that step with what it observed, and runs no later step

#### Scenario: Boundaries
- **WHEN** a harness starts
- **THEN** its edge listens on 127.0.0.1 on a port outside the installed services' ports, its state directory is mode 700 and removed afterwards, a state directory inside a Git checkout is refused with `state-dir-checkout`, and its tokens are unique and appear in no log record, edge record or message
