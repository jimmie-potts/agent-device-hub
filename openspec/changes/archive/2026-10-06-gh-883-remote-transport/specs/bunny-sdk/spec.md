## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Request and respond with expiry

One responder SHALL own each command key. A `respond` whose pattern overlaps another responder's SHALL be refused with `invalid-state`. `request` SHALL refuse with `invalid-request` a key outside `bunny.cmd`, a command type that does not end in `.requested`, a `timeoutMs` that is not an integer from 1 to `MAX_TIMEOUT_MS`, 86400000 (one day), and a `requestId` that is not an identifier. It SHALL send one command with a `requestId` in its payload and `expiresat` set `timeoutMs` after its `time`, and SHALL resolve with exactly one result, the reply or a result in its place; the command's outcome is a separate published message:
- `accepted`, with the reply message;
- `rejected`, with the shared error body: the responder's refusal, `internal` when the responder throws, `unavailable` when no responder owns the key or it closed before the command reached it, `capacity` when its queue is full, `expired` when the command never reached the responder's handler before its expiry, or `cancelled` when the requester closed before the handler started the command;
- `uncertain`, with `uncertain-result`, when the responder's handler had the command when the deadline passed or the requester closed.

At the deadline, the SDK SHALL take a command that is still waiting in the responder's queue out of that queue and resolve its request as `rejected` with `expired`. The SDK SHALL never send a command again and SHALL ignore a reply that arrives after the deadline. Every error body in a result SHALL carry the `requestId` and the command's trace ID. A responder SHALL handle one command at a time. It SHALL ignore a command whose expiry has passed, at or after `expiresat`, send no reply to it and resolve its request as `rejected` with `expired` unless the request has already settled.

#### Scenario: An accepted request
- **WHEN** a responder accepts a command
- **THEN** the requester gets `accepted` with a reply of kind `reply` from the responder's source, whose type ends in `.replied` and whose payload names the command's `requestId`, and both messages validate against profile 2.0

#### Scenario: A refusal in the shared error body
- **WHEN** a responder returns an error body, or throws
- **THEN** the requester gets `rejected` with that body, or with `internal` after the error is reported to `onError`, and the error carries the `requestId` and trace ID

#### Scenario: No responder
- **WHEN** a request names a key that no responder owns
- **THEN** it resolves at once as `rejected` with the retryable code `unavailable`

#### Scenario: A full responder queue
- **WHEN** a request reaches a responder whose queue already holds `maxQueued` waiting commands
- **THEN** it resolves at once as `rejected` with the retryable code `capacity`, carrying its `requestId` and trace ID

#### Scenario: A responder closes with commands waiting
- **WHEN** a responder closes while one command is being handled and another waits
- **THEN** the waiting request resolves as `rejected` with `unavailable`, carrying its `requestId` and trace ID, and the command being handled still gets its reply

#### Scenario: A malformed request
- **WHEN** a request uses a key outside `bunny.cmd`, a command type that does not end in `.requested`, a `timeoutMs` that is zero, negative, fractional, not finite or above `MAX_TIMEOUT_MS`, or a `requestId` that is not an identifier
- **THEN** it is refused with `invalid-request`

#### Scenario: A deadline recorded as uncertain
- **WHEN** the responder's handler has a command and no reply arrives before the deadline
- **THEN** the request stays pending until the deadline, then resolves as `uncertain` with `uncertain-result`, which is not retryable; a later reply changes nothing, and the responder receives the command only once

#### Scenario: A command still queued at its deadline
- **WHEN** a command waits behind another command in a responder's queue until its deadline passes
- **THEN** its request resolves as `rejected` with the non-retryable code `expired`, carrying its `requestId` and trace ID, the command leaves the queue, which then has room for another, and the responder's handler never receives it

#### Scenario: An expired command is ignored
- **WHEN** a command reaches the responder exactly at its expiry
- **THEN** the responder's handler never receives it, its request resolves at once as `rejected` with `expired`, and the responder handles the next command

#### Scenario: One owner per key
- **WHEN** a second responder registers a pattern that overlaps the first responder's
- **THEN** it is refused with `invalid-state`, and it can register after the first responder closes

### Requirement: Sync a consumer's copy from its owner

The SDK SHALL give each participant `sync(families, handler, {timeoutMs, maxBuffered, parent})`, which keeps a copy of one owner's families. It SHALL subscribe to `bunny.state.<family>.*` for each family before it sends any sync request of kind `sync-request` with a `requestId`, the families and `expiresat` set `timeoutMs` after its `time`, even when an overflow comes first. An entity SHALL be a state's schema family and `data.id`, or a removal's `data.entity`, at its `data.revision`.

Until the owner answers, live messages SHALL wait in a buffer of at most `maxBuffered` messages, 1024 by default. On the answer, the copy SHALL first take the owner's states. It SHALL then drop each held entity that is not a member and is at or below the sync revision, and apply each buffered message above the revision in order. Only then SHALL the handler be told about each change in that order: `updated`, `removed` and `synced`, so that when `synced` is told the copy has applied the snapshot and every buffered message above its revision. A change applied to the copy SHALL always be told, unless the copy was closed first.

After a sync, the copy SHALL apply live messages in order, with the same buffer bound while its handler catches up. It SHALL drop a duplicate, a revision older than the one it holds, anything at or below the sync revision, and a state at or below the revision of a removal it applied. A live message that names no entity of the synced families SHALL be reported to `onError` and ignored.

A buffer overflow, or a message dropped on one of the copy's subscriptions, SHALL make the copy want a new sync, and a served answer to a request sent before the latest overflow SHALL NOT be applied; a refusal still ends the first sync or the copy. Each such overflow SHALL be reported to the bus's `onSyncRestart` with the copy's source and `sync <families>` as its pattern. A copy SHALL have at most one sync request outstanding: it SHALL send the next one only when no other is outstanding and its handler is not running.

`sync` SHALL resolve with the copy after its first sync. If that sync is refused, `sync` SHALL resolve as `rejected` with the shared error body instead. If it has not completed within `timeoutMs` of its first request, `sync` SHALL resolve as `rejected` with `unavailable`, naming the last request it sent; each later request of the first sync SHALL get only the time left. Only the first request SHALL join `parent`'s trace; a later request SHALL start its own. After that, a sync that cannot be served SHALL end the copy with a `failed` change; the copy SHALL keep its last records. A refused or failed copy SHALL follow nothing more, however many messages arrive. Closing a copy SHALL withdraw its outstanding request, and a first sync still under way SHALL resolve as `rejected` with `cancelled`. A copy closed while it is still subscribing to its families SHALL make no further subscription and SHALL close the one it was making. A request that the transport rejects or throws on SHALL be reported to `onError` and refused with `unavailable`. A family list that is empty, longer than 32, repeated, not made of family names or longer than 256 characters joined SHALL be refused with `invalid-request`. So SHALL a `timeoutMs` that is not an integer from 1 to `MAX_TIMEOUT_MS` and a `maxBuffered` that is not a positive integer.

#### Scenario: Current state, then live messages
- **WHEN** an owner holds two sessions and a consumer syncs, and the owner later updates one
- **THEN** the handler hears `updated` for each session and `synced` at the owner's revision, the request and `sync.completed` validate against profile 2.0 and continue the caller's trace, and the later update arrives as `updated`

#### Scenario: Buffered live messages apply above the sync revision
- **WHEN** live messages at and below the snapshot's revision, and others above it, arrive while the answer is on its way
- **THEN** nothing is applied before the answer, the messages at or below the revision are dropped, and those above it apply after `synced`, in order

#### Scenario: An entity above the sync revision survives the sync
- **WHEN** a copy holds a@5, starts a sync, receives y@15 live, and the sync completes at revision 14 with members [a]
- **THEN** the copy holds a@5 and y@15

#### Scenario: A removal during a sync stays removed
- **WHEN** a removal of y at 16 arrives during a sync that completes at 14 listing y, and a state of y at 15 arrives afterwards
- **THEN** y is removed, and the late state does not bring it back

#### Scenario: A buffer overflow restarts the sync
- **WHEN** more live messages arrive during a sync than the buffer holds
- **THEN** a new sync request is sent, nothing from the first answer is applied, and the copy matches the second answer

#### Scenario: A sync replaces membership
- **WHEN** a copy holds a and b, b's removal is dropped by its full queue, and the next sync's members are [a]
- **THEN** the handler hears that b was removed without a removal message, and the copy holds only a

#### Scenario: A delivery-queue overflow restarts the sync
- **WHEN** the copy's subscription drops an update because its queue is full
- **THEN** the copy sends a new sync request and ends with the dropped update's state, not the older one

#### Scenario: A refused first sync
- **WHEN** the owner refuses the first sync with an error body
- **THEN** `sync` resolves as `rejected` with that body, its `requestId` and the caller's trace ID, the handler hears nothing, and later live messages do not reach it

#### Scenario: A later sync that cannot be served
- **WHEN** the owner stops serving and the copy's subscription then drops a message
- **THEN** the handler hears `failed` with `unavailable`, and the copy follows nothing more but keeps its last records

#### Scenario: Duplicates and stale revisions
- **WHEN** a synced copy receives a repeated state, older states, a state at or below the sync revision, a removal, a state older than that removal and the removal again
- **THEN** only the newer state and the first removal change the copy

#### Scenario: No replay
- **WHEN** an owner published occurrences and removed a session before a consumer syncs, and publishes another occurrence during the sync
- **THEN** the handler hears only the current state and `synced`

#### Scenario: A stalled handler
- **WHEN** a copy's handler stalls while 49 messages arrive, 46 more than its buffer of 3 holds
- **THEN** the owner receives no more than one further sync request, and once the handler returns it hears the resync rather than each buffered message

#### Scenario: A second consumer while another copy overflows
- **WHEN** one copy's buffer overflows again and again while the owner serves its request, and a second consumer then syncs
- **THEN** the second consumer is served next, and the first copy replaces its request once

#### Scenario: A copy's own requests and the owner's queue
- **WHEN** the owner's queue holds at most one waiting request and a copy overflows several times while its request is served
- **THEN** the copy completes its sync, never refused with `capacity` by its own requests

#### Scenario: A first sync that keeps overflowing
- **WHEN** two answers to a copy's first sync each arrive 400 ms after more live messages than its buffer holds, and a third never arrives
- **THEN** the third request gets only the 200 ms left, and `sync` resolves as `rejected` with the retryable `unavailable` at 1000 ms

#### Scenario: A first sync out of time
- **WHEN** the only answer to a first sync arrives at its deadline after an overflow
- **THEN** no further request is sent, and `sync` resolves as `rejected` with `unavailable` naming the request that was sent

#### Scenario: Subscriptions before any request
- **WHEN** a copy of two families sees an overflow on the first while the second is still subscribing
- **THEN** no request is sent until the second subscription exists, and then exactly one is

#### Scenario: Only the first request joins the caller's trace
- **WHEN** a copy synced with a parent trace syncs again after an overflow
- **THEN** the first request carries the parent's trace ID and the second starts a new trace

#### Scenario: A refused copy stays stopped
- **WHEN** an owner refuses a first sync, or a later sync fails, and more messages than the buffer holds then arrive while an owner serves
- **THEN** no further sync request is sent and the handler hears nothing more

#### Scenario: A snapshot older than the copy
- **WHEN** a copy applied a@5 live and a later sync answers with a cached snapshot at revision 3 that lacks a
- **THEN** the copy keeps a@5

#### Scenario: Closing during a change
- **WHEN** a copy is closed while its handler runs on the first of several changes from one answer
- **THEN** the close resolves after that handler returns, and the remaining changes are not told

#### Scenario: A message without an entity
- **WHEN** a live message on a synced family's key has no schema identifier
- **THEN** it is reported to `onError` with the copy's source and ignored, and later messages still apply

#### Scenario: A transport that fails
- **WHEN** the transport's sync request rejects, or throws
- **THEN** the error is reported, and `sync` resolves as `rejected` with `unavailable` naming the request

#### Scenario: Hub #842's reference scenarios
- **WHEN** each of the eight sync, removal and expiry scenarios in `fixtures/v2/families.json` is fed to SDK copies as a transport would deliver it
- **THEN** the copies hold exactly the entities the scenario expects

#### Scenario: A malformed sync call
- **WHEN** a sync names no family, a repeated or malformed family, more than 32 families or more than 256 characters of them joined, or has a bad `timeoutMs` or `maxBuffered`
- **THEN** it is refused with `invalid-request`

### Requirement: Per-subscriber delivery

Each subscription and each responder SHALL have its own queue, which delivers one message at a time in publish order. A slow handler SHALL delay only its own queue, never the sender, other subscribers or requests. `publish` SHALL NOT wait for any handler, and no handler SHALL run inside the sender's call. Each queue SHALL hold at most `maxQueued` waiting messages, 1024 by default; a `maxQueued` that is not a positive integer SHALL throw `RangeError`. When a subscription's queue is full, a new message SHALL be dropped for that subscription only, and `onError` SHALL receive an `SdkError` with code `capacity`. When a responder's queue is full, the requester SHALL get a `rejected` result with `capacity` instead. A subscription MAY pass `onOverflow`: after its full queue dropped one or more messages, the SDK SHALL call `onOverflow` with the number dropped since it was last told, and with no count when a remote connection was lost and restored, in the subscription's order and before the next message is delivered, and `onError` SHALL still receive each `capacity` report. The notice says that messages were dropped, not where: messages queued before the drop MAY be delivered after it. An `onOverflow` that throws SHALL be reported to `onError`, and delivery SHALL go on. A handler that throws SHALL be reported to `onError` and SHALL keep receiving. Without an `onError`, each report SHALL become a `BunnySdkWarning` process warning whose message names the source and pattern, with the original error as its `cause`. Closing a subscription SHALL drop its waiting messages and resolve when its running handler finishes. Called from that handler's own async flow while it runs, it SHALL resolve without waiting for it. Called from any other flow, including another subscription's handler or a continuation that a finished delivery of the same subscription left behind, it SHALL wait for the running handler. Close detection thus follows the handler's async flow: a callback that an emitter created elsewhere invokes is not in that flow, and two handlers that await each other's close deadlock.

#### Scenario: A slow subscriber delays only itself
- **WHEN** one subscriber's handler stays blocked on its first message while five messages are published
- **THEN** publishing resolves without waiting, another subscriber receives all five, a request is still answered, and the slow subscriber receives the rest in order once released

#### Scenario: A slow responder delays only its own commands
- **WHEN** a responder's handler is blocked
- **THEN** subscribers still receive published messages, and the pending request resolves once the handler answers

#### Scenario: A full queue
- **WHEN** a blocked subscriber's queue already holds `maxQueued` waiting messages and more are published
- **THEN** those messages are dropped for that subscriber only, `onError` receives `capacity` for each one with the subscriber's source and pattern, and other subscribers receive every message

#### Scenario: A queue limit that is not a positive integer
- **WHEN** a bus is created with a `maxQueued` of zero, a negative, fractional or non-finite number, or a number above the safe-integer range
- **THEN** the constructor throws `RangeError`

#### Scenario: A handler that throws
- **WHEN** a subscriber's handler throws
- **THEN** the error is reported to `onError`, or as a `BunnySdkWarning` naming the source and pattern with the error as its `cause` when no `onError` is given, and the subscriber receives the next message

#### Scenario: Closing during a delivery
- **WHEN** a subscription closes while its handler is running and another message waits
- **THEN** the close resolves after the running handler finishes, and the waiting message is never delivered

#### Scenario: Closing from inside the handler
- **WHEN** a subscriber's handler, or a responder, closes its own subscription and waits for the close
- **THEN** the close resolves, the handler finishes, no later message reaches it, and the responder's reply arrives as `accepted`

#### Scenario: A subscriber told about dropped messages
- **WHEN** a stalled subscription that passed `onOverflow` has messages dropped because its queue is full, and its handler is then released
- **THEN** `onOverflow` receives the number dropped before the next message is delivered, even one queued before the drop, `onError` has received `capacity` for each one, other subscribers received every message, and a later message arrives without another notice until the next drop

#### Scenario: Closing another subscription from a handler
- **WHEN** one subscription's handler closes a second subscription whose handler is running
- **THEN** the close resolves only after the second subscription's handler finishes

#### Scenario: A continuation left by a finished delivery
- **WHEN** a continuation that a finished delivery started closes the same subscription while a later delivery's handler runs
- **THEN** the close resolves only after that later handler finishes

#### Scenario: A gap with no count
- **WHEN** a remote participant's stream is lost and the client reconnects
- **THEN** each of its subscriptions receives `onOverflow` with no `dropped` count before its next message

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Publish a prepared message

The SDK SHALL give each participant `publishMessage(key, message)`, which publishes a message built earlier, such as one an outbox stored, unchanged: its `id`, `time` and trace context SHALL stay as they are. It SHALL follow `publish`'s key-class rules, SHALL refuse a kind that is not published with `invalid-request`, and SHALL refuse a message whose `source` is not the participant's with `forbidden`.

#### Scenario: An outbox resends a stored message
- **WHEN** a participant publishes a message and later publishes the same message again with `publishMessage`, on either transport
- **THEN** subscribers receive both, with the same `id` and `time`

#### Scenario: Another source's message
- **WHEN** a participant publishes a message whose `source` is another participant's
- **THEN** it is refused with `forbidden`

### Requirement: Carry the SDK calls to remote parts over SSE and HTTP

The SDK SHALL offer a `RemoteEdge` on an in-process bus and a client, `connectRemote`, that gives a remote part the same calls as a module. Messages SHALL flow down one `text/event-stream` per connection at `GET /api/sdk/v1/stream`, and calls SHALL go up as `POST /api/sdk/v1/<call>`. Every frame SHALL carry `schema` `sdk-remote/1.0`, and every refusal SHALL be the shared error body.

- **Credentials:** each remote source SHALL have a bearer token, compared in constant time. The edge SHALL refuse at start a grant with a malformed source or a token that two grants share. A call without a granted token SHALL be refused with `unauthenticated`. A message or connection of another source SHALL be refused with `forbidden`, including a close, reply or sync answer on another source's connection. A token SHALL NOT appear in any message, log record or error body.
- **Validation:** the client SHALL build every message, which keeps its own `id` and `time`. The edge SHALL validate each inbound message against profile 2.0, its registered payload schema and the 256 KiB cap, with its clock, and SHALL refuse a failing one with the validator's code (`invalid-message`, `too-large`, `unknown-schema`, `unsupported-version` or `expired`) before it reaches the bus. It SHALL refuse a sync request whose subject is not its families joined by commas with `invalid-message`, and a call body over its limit with `too-large` without reading the rest. It SHALL rebuild a remote responder's or owner's refusal as the shared error body, with its registered code and at most 1024 characters of detail, and SHALL drop anything else it carried.
- **Subscriptions:** `subscribe` SHALL resolve only once the edge has registered the subscription.
- **A slow consumer:** the edge SHALL wait for a connection's socket to drain before it writes the next message of a subscription, so a remote part that stops reading fills only its own subscriptions' bounded queues. Their drops SHALL be reported to `onError` as `capacity` and sent to the remote part as an overflow notice with the count.
- **Reconnects:** a client whose stream is lost SHALL reconnect, queue a gap notice with no count for each subscription before any message of the new stream, register its subscriptions, responders and sync owners again, and only then deliver the notices. Nothing missed SHALL be replayed. A call that needs the stream and meets a lost one SHALL be refused with the retryable `unavailable`, and a registration that failed SHALL leave nothing at the edge.
- **A dropped stream:** the edge SHALL NOT answer a forwarded command whose frame reached the socket because its stream dropped. A reply that comes on the reconnected stream SHALL still reach the requester; otherwise the deadline decides. A forwarded command whose frame never reached the socket, and a forwarded sync request, SHALL be refused with `unavailable`.
- **Deadlines:** the deadline answers SHALL be those in process. The edge SHALL answer when its bus settles: `expired` for a command still queued at its deadline, `uncertain-result` for one a handler had, otherwise the reply, and `unavailable` for a sync request. A remote requester SHALL wait `REQUESTER_GRACE_MS` (1 s) past its deadline, on its scheduler, for that answer, and only then settle a command as `uncertain-result` and a sync as `unavailable`. An edge `expired` refusal of a remote part's own sync request SHALL reach it as the retryable `unavailable`. A remote responder or owner SHALL ignore a command or sync request that reaches it past its expiry.
- **Close:** a remote participant SHALL be a participant whose `close` returns the same promise every time. It SHALL first settle each request still waiting for the edge as `uncertain-result`, drop its call and cancel its deadline and the reconnect backoff; the edge SHALL then take a still-queued command out. It SHALL then close its sync copies, so a first sync still under way resolves `cancelled`; a copy's withdrawn request SHALL drop its HTTP call, and the edge SHALL take the request out of the owner's queue, so the owner never serves it. Every later call SHALL be refused with `invalid-state`.
- **Schedulers:** the client's deadlines and reconnect delays and the edge's waits SHALL run on an injectable scheduler, which defaults to `setTimeout`.
- **Sync answers:** the edge SHALL refuse a sync answer that has a state or `sync.completed` over 256 KiB with `too-large` and log it, so a first sync resolves `rejected` with that code and a later one ends the copy with `failed`.

#### Scenario: Credentials
- **WHEN** a call has no token or an ungranted one, or a granted token publishes another source's message
- **THEN** it is refused with `unauthenticated` or `forbidden` in the error body, and no token appears in the messages, log records and error bodies the test captured

#### Scenario: A refused message
- **WHEN** a remote part sends a message whose payload fails its schema, one over 256 KiB, one of an unregistered family, a call body over the call limit or a body that is not JSON
- **THEN** the edge refuses it with `invalid-message`, `too-large`, `unknown-schema`, `too-large` or `invalid-request`, and the message never reaches the bus

#### Scenario: An expired sync request at the edge
- **WHEN** a sync request reaches the edge past its expiry
- **THEN** it is refused with `expired`

#### Scenario: A reconnect resyncs without replay
- **WHEN** a remote copy's stream is lost while the owner changes a session, removes another and a turn ends
- **THEN** after the reconnect each subscription hears of the gap with no count, the copy resyncs to the owner's current state with the removed session dropped, and the occurrence is not replayed

#### Scenario: A slow remote consumer
- **WHEN** a remote part stops reading its stream while 150 messages of 100 KB are published
- **THEN** another subscriber receives all 150, drops for the slow subscription go to `onError`, and once it reads again it receives an overflow notice with the count

#### Scenario: The edge's deadline answer, and a silent edge
- **WHEN** a remote requester's command is held by a handler past a 300 ms deadline, and another requester, whose scheduler holds its callbacks, sends a command with a one-minute deadline and the test runs its deadline plus grace
- **THEN** the first resolves as `uncertain-result` with the bus's own refusal, before the grace ends, and the second as `uncertain-result` because the edge did not answer

#### Scenario: A dropped stream while a remote handler holds a command
- **WHEN** a remote responder's stream drops while its handler holds a command
- **THEN** the requester gets `uncertain-result` at the deadline, never `unavailable`, and when the handler replies on the reconnected stream before the deadline, the requester gets that reply

#### Scenario: Remote refusals rebuilt
- **WHEN** a remote responder or owner refuses with a registered code, a 5000-character detail and an extra field
- **THEN** the requester gets the shared error body with that code, the detail cut to 1024 characters and no extra field

#### Scenario: Security and cleanup checks
- **WHEN** a token acts on another source's connection, a remote responder and owner reconnect twice, a remote responder's clock is ahead, or a command reaches the edge past its expiry
- **THEN** the call is `forbidden`, the responder and owner still serve, the responder never sees the expired command, and the edge refuses it with `expired`

#### Scenario: A call on a lost stream
- **WHEN** a remote part registers a responder on a stream the edge has just dropped
- **THEN** the call is refused with the retryable `unavailable`, and after the reconnect the same key can be registered again

#### Scenario: A sync request's clock skew
- **WHEN** a remote part whose clock is ten minutes behind syncs
- **THEN** the sync resolves as `rejected` with the retryable `unavailable`

#### Scenario: Grants and close
- **WHEN** the edge is given grants with a shared token or a malformed source, or a remote participant closes during its reconnect backoff
- **THEN** the edge refuses the grants with `invalid-request` without naming the token, and nothing is left on the participant's scheduler

#### Scenario: A sync answer over the cap
- **WHEN** an owner's snapshot makes `sync.completed` larger than 256 KiB
- **THEN** a remote copy that syncs again ends with `failed` and `too-large`, a first sync resolves `rejected` with `too-large`, and the edge logs the refusal

### Requirement: One conformance suite for every transport

One conformance suite SHALL run the same SDK calls against the in-process bus and the remote transport. A command still queued at its deadline SHALL be `expired` on both. Where a transport must answer differently, it SHALL state its own expectation: a closing participant's request whose command still waits in the responder's queue is `cancelled` in process, where the bus knows, and `uncertain-result` remotely, where the requester cannot; on both, the command never runs.

#### Scenario: Both transports
- **WHEN** the suite runs against each transport
- **THEN** both pass the same cases:
  - routing by pattern, with messages delivered exactly as published;
  - prepared messages;
  - subscriptions live before `subscribe` resolves;
  - request and respond, with refusals in the error body on the caller's trace;
  - no responder, and both deadline cases;
  - sync, with an owner's refusal and the `unavailable` deadline;
  - an overflow count;
  - malformed calls;
  - a closed participant refusing every call with `invalid-state`;
  - a closing participant's first sync resolving `cancelled`, with its waiting request never reaching the owner;
  - a closing participant's waiting request settled, the command never running and a second close returning the same promise;
  - a sync request and its `sync.completed` naming the families, joined by commas;
  - a `timeoutMs` above `MAX_TIMEOUT_MS` refused with `invalid-request`.
