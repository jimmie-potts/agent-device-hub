## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Start and serve health with zero modules

The runtime SHALL start with the fixed module list shipped in its code, and SHALL NOT load modules any other way. The shipped list SHALL hold the agent-session core first, then the device modules, the playback module (`runtime-playback`) and the LIFX module (`lifx-module`, Hub #928) so far, and the runtime SHALL also run with no module at all. Without a configuration file, the runtime SHALL refuse each shipped module that takes one, as "Module configuration" requires, with `not-found`, show it `refused` in health, and run the others. It SHALL serve `GET /api/runtime/v1/health` on the loopback address at a configured port, where 0 picks a free port. Health SHALL answer 200 with a `runtime-health/1.0` document while the process serves: `status` `ok` when every module runs and the lag check, if any, is active, and `degraded` otherwise; the supported module API version, the start time, uptime, the process's memory, the lag check's status; and one entry per module with its name, API version, state, `healthy`, its count of sync restarts and, when refused or failed, a reason whose code comes from the 2.0 error registry. The server SHALL answer only a request that names it as its host, `127.0.0.1:<port>` or `localhost:<port>` in any letter case with the exact port, and carries no `Origin` and no `Sec-Fetch-Site` other than `none`; any other request SHALL answer 403 with the shared error body and code `forbidden`. Every other method, path or query SHALL answer 404 with the shared error body and code `not-found`, except the SDK edge's routes while the edge is configured (see "Simulated modules and the SDK edge"). Stopping the runtime SHALL stop every module and close the health server; stopping again SHALL return the same result. In the service process, SIGTERM or SIGINT SHALL stop every module and exit 0. The entry point SHALL catch both signals before the rest of the runtime loads: a signal while it loads SHALL exit 0 before anything is created, and a signal while modules start SHALL stop them once their starts settle, without a ready line.

#### Scenario: Zero modules
- **WHEN** the runtime starts with no modules on port 0
- **THEN** health on a loopback port answers 200 with schema `runtime-health/1.0`, status `ok`, module API version `1.1`, positive memory figures and no modules

#### Scenario: Another route
- **WHEN** a client sends GET to `/`, POST to the health path, GET with a query string or GET to another version's path
- **THEN** each answers 404 with `{"error": {"code": "not-found", "retryable": false, "detail": "no such route"}}`

#### Scenario: A request that does not name the listener
- **WHEN** a request names another host, omits the port, carries an `Origin`, or carries `Sec-Fetch-Site` `cross-site` or `same-origin`
- **THEN** it answers 403 with `forbidden`, as does one naming another port, while requests naming `127.0.0.1:<port>` or `localhost:<port>` in any letter case, with or without `Sec-Fetch-Site` `none`, answer 200

#### Scenario: Sync restarts in health
- **WHEN** a module's sync copy overflows a buffer of one while its handler is stalled, and restarts its sync
- **THEN** that module's health entry counts one sync restart, another module counts none, and the module keeps running

#### Scenario: Stopping
- **WHEN** the runtime stops, and stops again
- **THEN** the health server no longer accepts connections, and the second stop resolves

#### Scenario: The shipped process
- **WHEN** the shipped entry point runs with `--port 0` and a private state directory
- **THEN** it writes a `runtime.ready` line with its URL, health is `degraded` and lists the core running and each shipped device module, the playback and LIFX modules, `refused` with `not-found`, because the process has no configuration file, the records name each refusal, and SIGTERM stops it with exit status 0

#### Scenario: A signal while the runtime loads
- **WHEN** SIGTERM or SIGINT arrives while the entry point still loads the runtime, whether loading turns the event loop or blocks it
- **THEN** the process exits 0 with no ready line, and the state directory was never created

#### Scenario: The entry point loads through its launcher
- **WHEN** the built entry point is read
- **THEN** its only static import is the launcher

#### Scenario: A signal during startup
- **WHEN** SIGTERM or SIGINT arrives while a module's start is still running
- **THEN** the process stops that module once its start settles, writes no ready line and exits 0

#### Scenario: Malformed arguments
- **WHEN** the entry point runs without `--port`, with a port that is not an integer from 0 to 65535, a lag limit that is not a positive integer or an unknown option
- **THEN** it exits with status 2 and a usage line

### Requirement: Simulated modules and the SDK edge

The shipped module list SHALL be a list of module factories, each of which creates its module with its real device transport or with its simulated one, and, for a module that takes a configuration, gives a section that configures its simulated build with the names of the secrets it needs (Hub #844, #929); with `--simulate`, the runtime SHALL build every module with its simulated transport. With `--edge`, the runtime SHALL serve the SDK's remote transport (`RemoteEdge`, #883) on its health listener under `/api/sdk/v1/`, on the modules' bus, under the same local-request rules as health. The edge SHALL serve only once every module's start has settled, and only until the runtime stops: before then, and from the start of a stop until the listener closes, its routes SHALL answer 503 with `unavailable`. Its grants SHALL come from `edge-grants.json` in the state directory, `{"schema": "edge-grants/1.0", "grants": [{source, token}]}`: a private file (mode 600, one link, owned by the runtime's user) never reached through a link, with at least one grant, well-formed sources, tokens of 32 to 512 characters without spaces, and no token shared. A grant whose source is the core's (`bunny/core`) or a module's (`bunny/modules/<name>`) SHALL be refused, so no remote part can publish as either. The runtime SHALL refuse to start, before it serves, with `edge-grants-missing`, `edge-grants-not-private`, `edge-grants-invalid` or `edge-grant-source` as the `runtime.failed` record's `error.code`. No refusal or log record SHALL quote a token. The edge SHALL check remote messages against profile 2.0, the core families, the device families that every device module answers (Hub #918, #928), the modules' own schemas and any families the caller adds, and the runtime SHALL log the edge's connections, disconnections and refusals. As the diagnostic contract requires, a record SHALL NOT hold the raw message or stack: a refusal's record SHALL hold its route, or `other` when the route is none of the edge's, its granted source if any, its code from the 2.0 error registry and, in the diagnostic contract's `bunny.reason`, that code's fixed registered reason (none for `internal` or `uncertain-result`, whose effect may have happened), and never the refusal's detail. The `runtime.started` record SHALL say whether modules are simulated and whether the edge is configured, and a `runtime.edge.serving` record SHALL follow once the edge serves; both SHALL carry the listener's port, never its URL. Stopping the runtime SHALL close the edge before it stops the modules.

#### Scenario: A remote part with a grant
- **WHEN** the runtime runs with an edge, the fixture core and a grant for `bunny/parts/reader`
- **THEN** a remote part with that grant connects and syncs the core's sessions, one with another token is `unauthenticated`, a call without a token answers 401, the edge's connection is logged with its source, and no token appears in a log record

#### Scenario: Before the modules have started
- **WHEN** a remote part keeps trying to connect with its grant while a module's start is still running
- **THEN** the edge answers 503 with `unavailable` until the start settles, and the same part's next attempt connects; a request with a browser `Origin` answers 403

#### Scenario: While the runtime stops
- **WHEN** the runtime is stopping and a module's stop is still running
- **THEN** the edge's stream and calls answer 503 with `unavailable` until the listener closes

#### Scenario: An edge refusal in the log
- **WHEN** a remote part calls a route the edge does not have, sends a malformed call, or calls without a token
- **THEN** each refusal is logged with its route or `other`, its registry code and that code's registered reason, and nothing the caller sent appears in a log record

#### Scenario: A grants file the runtime refuses
- **WHEN** the grants file is missing, has mode 644, is a symbolic link or a second hard link, is not JSON, names another schema, lists no grant, has a short token, a malformed source or a token two grants share
- **THEN** the runtime refuses to start with `edge-grants-missing`, `edge-grants-not-private` or `edge-grants-invalid`, and the refusal never quotes a token

#### Scenario: A grant that acts as the core or a module
- **WHEN** a grant names `bunny/core`, `bunny/modules/lamp` or `bunny/modules/core`, through `startRuntime` or the shipped entry point with `--edge`
- **THEN** the runtime refuses to start with `edge-grant-source`, which the entry point names in `runtime.failed` with exit status 1 and no ready line

#### Scenario: Device commands through the edge
- **WHEN** remote parts send `device-mode-set`, `power-set` and `lifx-color-set` commands through the edge to the LIFX module in the catalog's `lifx-bulbs` scenario
- **THEN** the edge takes each as its device or module family, the module answers each, and every message the parts see follows profile 2.0

#### Scenario: Simulated modules
- **WHEN** the shipped entry point runs with `--simulate` and `--edge` and a private grants file
- **THEN** a remote part with a run grant reaches its edge, the `runtime.started` record says the modules are simulated and the edge is configured, one `runtime.edge.serving` record follows once every module has started, SIGTERM stops it with exit status 0, and each module factory builds its simulated module under `--simulate` and its real one otherwise
