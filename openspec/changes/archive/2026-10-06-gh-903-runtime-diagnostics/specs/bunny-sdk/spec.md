## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Module test kit

The SDK SHALL export, from `@jimmie-potts/sdk/testing`, one conformance suite that any module runs from a description of it: a factory for fresh instances, its payload schemas, and, each optional, the families it serves, the families it copies with the snapshot a stand-in owner serves, a command it accepts and a command it refuses with its error code. `moduleConformance(spec)` SHALL register the checks as a node:test suite named for the module and SHALL be the only part of the kit that loads `node:test`. `conformanceChecks(spec)` SHALL return the checks that apply as `{name, run}` for any runner. Each check SHALL host a fresh instance with `ModuleHarness` on its own bus and state directory, with a stand-in owner, `bunny/core`, for the copied families. Each check SHALL fail when any message it sees breaks profile 2.0, with the core families, the stand-in acknowledgment and the module's schemas registered; when a record the module logs is not one the runtime writes whole as a diagnostic-contract record, because its event is not registered for the `bunny.module` scope, a field is not a registered attribute, or a value is outside its registered type; or when a handler, timer or worker of the module fails, or its stop throws or outlasts its deadline. `checkModuleRecord(name, record)` SHALL return that record check's reason, naming the event and attribute keys but never a value, or undefined. The checks SHALL be:
- always, the manifest is one the runtime accepts;
- always, the module starts and stops within the deadline, and afterwards its accepted command and its served families, when given, are `unavailable`, and no timer or worker it started through its context and no open database is left;
- with served families, a sync of them completes with states of those families from the module;
- with copied families, its start syncs them and asks for nothing else;
- with an accepted command, it accepts it;
- with a refused command, it refuses it in its own reply with the declared code;
- with an accepted command, the command's outcome is published, and published again, unchanged, after a restart on the same database without an acknowledgment.

`ModuleHarness` SHALL host a module as the runtime does: its own participant with source `bunny/modules/<name>`, given to the module without `close`; a context whose SQLite file is `<name>.sqlite` in a given directory; and a stop that aborts the signal, cancels timers, closes the participant, runs `stop()`, ends workers and closes the database. The participant close and `stop()` SHALL each have a deadline, 5 s by default, and a step that throws or outlasts it SHALL be recorded as a failure without keeping the later steps from running.

Until Hub #782 defines the core's acknowledgment, the kit SHALL offer a stand-in: `standInAck(outcome)`, an occurrence on `bunny.event.stand-in-ack.<module>`, and `followStandInAcks(sdk, outbox)`, which passes each one naming the module's outcome to `outbox.acknowledge`.

#### Scenario: A conforming module passes
- **WHEN** a module that serves its family, answers its command and reports the outcome through its outbox runs the suite
- **THEN** every check passes, and there is no copies check when it copies nothing

#### Scenario: A module that only consumes
- **WHEN** a module that copies the mode and serves and answers nothing runs the suite
- **THEN** only the manifest, lifecycle and copies checks run, and they pass

#### Scenario: The kit catches a non-conforming module
- **WHEN** a module publishes its outcome without the outbox, declares an unsupported API version, refuses with another code, has a stop that never finishes, or sends a state its schema refuses
- **THEN** the outbox check; the manifest check; the refusal check; the lifecycle and outbox checks; or the sync, accept and outbox checks fail, respectively, and every other check passes

#### Scenario: The kit catches a module record the runtime would not write
- **WHEN** a module logs an event the catalog does not register for modules, one of the runtime's own events, an unregistered attribute holding a raw message, or a URL in a registered attribute, while it handles its accepted command
- **THEN** the accept and outbox checks fail, every other check passes, and the reason names no value

#### Scenario: The harness stops a module as the runtime does
- **WHEN** a hosted module's stop throws, or never finishes
- **THEN** the module had no `close` on its participant, the harness's stop still ends within its deadline and closes the database, and it records the error or the passed deadline as a failure

#### Scenario: Another runner
- **WHEN** a process imports the kit, or Vitest runs `conformanceChecks`
- **THEN** `node:test` is not loaded
