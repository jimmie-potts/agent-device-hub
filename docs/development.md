# Development setup

## System design documents

The human-facing design set is HTML under `docs/system-design/`. Edit
`source/*.html` and `design.json`, then regenerate the overview, component pages
and complete reading view. `assets/` holds the shared style and browser behavior.
The inventory records the originating template set and source revision receipts.

```bash
python3 docs/system-design/build.py
python3 docs/system-design/build.py --check
python3 docs/system-design/check.py
node docs/system-design/check.cjs
```

The generator and static check use Python's standard library. Browser checks use
installed Playwright/Chromium, with the same `GUIDE_PLAYWRIGHT_MODULE` and
`GUIDE_CHROMIUM_PATH` overrides as the work guide. `BUNNY_DESIGN_RECEIPTS` selects
an external screenshot/PDF/receipt directory; the default is a temporary folder.
The Work guide CI job runs these document checks using its pinned browser setup.

The diagram JSON is rendered by the installed archify skill. Keep its validated
HTML and specification together. Browser screenshots and local delivery receipts
remain outside Git. This documentation workflow starts no application, installs
no hooks and contacts no devices. Product contracts and runtime acceptance remain
with their existing owners. No new OpenSpec capability is introduced by the atlas.

## Workflow commands

Use Node 24 and npm from the assigned worktree root:

```bash
npm ci
npm run check:workflow
npm run test:workflow
```

Both checks must exit zero. The product specification inventory is
controller-contracts, shared-mcp-gateway and agent-lifecycle-contract after
the Hub #2 change is synchronized.

OpenSpec 1.12.0 is pinned locally. Use npm run openspec -- <arguments>. Its wrapper
isolates configuration and suppresses telemetry/completion migration. Initialize
using init --tools none --profile core --no-animation. Do not generate local
skill integrations or run a global OpenSpec installation.

For a WSL sandbox with a read-only npm cache, use a writable temporary cache.
Keep dependency caches, browser binaries and all runtime state outside source.

GitHub CI runs on pull requests and pushes to main. Superseded PR revisions
are cancelled per workflow and PR; main revisions keep independent runs. Each
job has a ten-minute timeout. Branch pushes do not duplicate PR checks.

Both Hub workflows use `paths-ignore: ['docs/work-guide/**']` for PRs and main
pushes. Guide-only edits, including generators and tests, retain local guide
validation under [the SDLC exception](sdlc.md#guide-only-ci-exception). Mixed
changes run every configured job. See [GitHub's path-filter rules](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/workflow-syntax):
PRs use three-dot diffs and existing-branch pushes use two-dot diffs. Filtering
considers at most 300 changed files; a larger mixed diff can miss an outside path.
Over 1,000 commits or a diff-generation timeout causes a run. Do not rely on a
filtered result when the complete changed-file scope is uncertain or mixed;
retain the normal gate and split a large change when necessary. Tag pushes are
outside the existing main-only push trigger. Static tests verify configuration;
only hosted event evidence verifies actual scheduling.

Product CI jobs run `npm run build` and `npm run typecheck` once, then use
`:built` variants of the controller, lifecycle and MCP TypeScript/package test
commands. These variants require output freshly built in that same job. The
existing standalone commands still build first and stop if compilation fails.
Python commands are unchanged. Python setup caches pip downloads by runtime,
platform and `requirements-contracts.txt`; dependency installation still runs.
No installed dependencies or compiled output are shared between jobs.

GitHub CI requires Workflow checks on Ubuntu and Windows and four contract jobs,
one for each Ubuntu/Windows and Python 3.12/3.14 combination. The contract jobs
run build, type, both language corpora and isolated package checks. Later runtime
and browser changes must add their own issue-appropriate checks.

The configured MCP jobs run build/type, tool/service tests, loopback protocol tests
and isolated archive-consumer checks on Ubuntu and Windows. Local validation runs
the same commands. Keep platform coverage and delivery-specific CI exceptions in
the external validation receipt.

## Shared tooling provenance

The bootstrap wrapper, validator and fixtures adapt the existing Pixoo tooling
at revision 4fd259b08ff22dcf73938162f7dff67b71d23ed9. They preserve its CLI and
configuration-isolation behavior. This temporary bootstrap copy is recorded;
[agent-device-hub#10](https://github.com/jimmie-potts/agent-device-hub/issues/10) owns publishing the common package, and [divoom-app-upgrade#38](https://github.com/jimmie-potts/divoom-app-upgrade/issues/38) and
[codex-nanoleaf#31](https://github.com/jimmie-potts/codex-nanoleaf/issues/31) own replacing the device copies. No shared skill is vendored.

## Agent setup

Use the reviewed [agent-skills catalog](https://github.com/jimmie-potts/agent-skills)
outside this checkout. The workflow uses code-review, tdd,
grill-with-docs, grilling, domain-modeling, writing-for-agents, unslop and the
OpenSpec propose/explore/apply/update/sync/archive skills.

Use [docs/sdlc.md](sdlc.md) for delivery. Use the shared deliver-work skill only
when the user explicitly invokes it, while retaining repository gates.

Inspect installed paths first. Provision only missing skills through the catalog
manager when the user authorizes personal setup; preserve conflicts and the source
checkout supporting installed links. Do not copy methods or external symlinks here.

Codex reads root AGENTS.md; Claude reads CLAUDE.md, which imports @AGENTS.md.
[Codex discovery](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/agent-configuration/agents-md)
and [Claude imports](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory#agentsmd) define those
mechanisms. Links to docs are conditional read instructions, not automatic imports.

Verify actual discovery in a fresh authorized host session before claiming
host compatibility. A filesystem link, static instruction exercise or CI pass
alone does not establish live Codex/Claude loading or lifecycle events. Check
root and each nested controller launch directory independently. For controller
work launched at the root, AGENTS.md explicitly requires reading the scoped
README.md and AGENTS.md. Each controller CLAUDE.md imports its local AGENTS.md;
the scoped instructions require the root rules too.

Keep personal Claude/Codex settings, authentication, trust, hook files and runtime
data outside the repository. One branch/worktree and coordinating writer owns each
active deliverable; shared Git operations and installations still need ownership.

## Package and controller validation

The chosen development direction is Node 24, TypeScript and npm workspaces for
new shared packages and the Tidbyt/LIFX controllers. No workspace packages or
runtime entry points are created by the documentation bootstrap. The first
implementing issue adds the needed manifests, package boundaries and executable
commands to this document and CI. The migrated Nanoleaf worker remains Python;
sharing a repository does not require a common runtime or combined process.

Reserve shared contracts, root package/lockfile changes and CI for the coordinating
writer. Work on separate deliverables uses separate worktrees, even for different
controller directories. Reconcile the latest shared changes before validation.
Run changed-package build/type/tests and every affected contract consumer, plus
the repository workflow checks. A green unrelated package does not validate a
controller. Use fake transports and temporary runtime data for source checks;
ordinary setup must never discover or contact physical devices.

[agent-device-hub#2](https://github.com/jimmie-potts/agent-device-hub/issues/2) owns provider qualification; [agent-device-hub#4](https://github.com/jimmie-potts/agent-device-hub/issues/4) owns the device
contract and cross-language fixtures. [agent-device-hub#3](https://github.com/jimmie-potts/agent-device-hub/issues/3) owns reusable core/package
tests. Consumer changes must run those fixtures against supported contract
versions without private metadata or a physical device.

Define versioned artifacts and a compatibility matrix before a second repository
depends on an exported package. Never import a package from another developer's
checkout path. Changes to shared contracts must validate every affected consumer.

Installation and physical testing follow docs/sdlc.md and the owning device guide.
No bootstrap command installs the app, changes hooks, reads live device credentials
or sends device requests.

## Instruction validation

For instruction-only changes, check these branches statically and report the
files that resolve each rule. Live host discovery requires a separately
authorized session and must be reported separately.

| Task | Expected instruction path and boundary |
| --- | --- |
| Root-launched Tidbyt edit | Root AGENTS.md directs the reader to controllers/tidbyt/README.md and AGENTS.md; cloud source work uses fakes. |
| Nested LIFX launch | Ancestor/root instructions plus controllers/lifx/AGENTS.md; do not infer the exact model or scan the LAN. |
| Claude controller work | Root CLAUDE.md imports root AGENTS.md; controller CLAUDE.md imports scoped AGENTS.md. Scoped rules require the root rules. |
| Shared contract or lockfile edit | Read architecture, linked contracts and this guide; coordinate ownership and test every affected consumer. |
| Request to implement a future controller | Read its exact issue and readiness decisions; bootstrap completion alone grants no implementation or installation authority. |
| Source-only Tronbyt change | Qualify connection behavior with fakes; firmware, server installation and physical transition require separate explicit authorization. |

## Controller contract checks

Use Node 24 and Python 3.12 or 3.14 from the worktree root. After npm ci, install
Python dependencies in an isolated environment with
`python3 -m pip install -r requirements-contracts.txt`.

Run `npm run build`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test:contracts`,
`npm run test:contracts:python` and `npm run test:package`. Every command must
exit zero. Both languages execute the same 134 schema and 86 semantic cases.
The package check installs a newly built archive into a temporary consumer,
checks every manifest hash, imports the named package, and runs both full corpora.
It requires npm dependency access and creates no device or controller service.

`npm run package:contracts` writes the versioned archive and SHA-256 sidecar under
ignored artifacts/. Record the source commit and checksum outside that commit
when publishing an immutable private release asset for downstream adoption.
Python loads the module with the extracted package's python/ directory on
PYTHONPATH; it requires the bundled relative schemas/ directory. Keep the package
layout intact. No sibling-checkout import is supported.

## Reusable MCP checks

Run `npm run test:mcp`, `npm run test:mcp:protocol` and
`npm run test:mcp:package`, in addition to the existing build/type, both-language
contracts and workflow checks. Tests start ephemeral loopback servers and use
synthetic authentication and fake owning services. No test discovers or contacts
a device or launches an installed agent client.

`npm run package:mcp` creates `@jimmie-potts/device-mcp` 1.0.0 under artifacts/.
The private controller-contract archive is pinned under vendor/ with its original
release receipt. Packaging verifies its SHA-256 before bundling it. The MCP package
test installs outside the checkout, verifies both manifests, runs the tool/protocol
suite and typechecks consumer examples without private-registry credentials.

Pin the resulting immutable private MCP release archive and receipt in each
consumer's vendor directory before adoption. Consumer CI then needs no new
cross-repository secret. Keep actual MCP release source/hash receipts outside the
reviewed commit. Read [the module guide](../packages/mcp/README.md) for the API,
protocol matrix, SDK license and remaining installed-client/physical acceptance.

## Agent lifecycle contract checks

Hub #2 adds `packages/lifecycle-contracts`, a private versioned lifecycle schema
and TypeScript/Python consumers. Use Node 24 and Python 3.12 or 3.14, run `npm ci`
and install `requirements-contracts.txt` in an isolated Python environment.
Run `npm run build`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test:lifecycle`,
`npm run test:lifecycle:python` and `npm run test:lifecycle:package`, in addition
to all existing workflow, controller-contract and MCP checks. Lifecycle CI runs
on Ubuntu/Windows with both Python versions. Tests use synthetic metadata only.
`npm run package:lifecycle` builds the private archive with a file-hash manifest;
record its source revision and archive hash externally after reviewed delivery.
No command installs hooks, launches a client or contacts a device.

## Early performance measurement tooling

`npm run test:performance` uses Python 3.12 or 3.14 to check measurement
statistics, pinned source verification, isolated legacy admission and bounded
worker failure handling. The existing lifecycle Linux/Windows Python matrix
also runs this command; all previous jobs and checks remain required. The
tests use synthetic state and do not establish installed-client, full hook,
helper-route or physical performance. See [the early measurement procedure](performance-baseline.md)
for actual profile commands and pending budget gates.

## Linux hook performance qualification

Run `npm run test:performance:linux` on Linux with system Python 3.12 or 3.14
under `/usr` and the packaged `bwrap` executable available. These thirteen focused
checks execute the pinned real hook in disposable PID/network/mount namespaces,
verify provenance and failure retention, and test detached-child cleanup. They
perform no timing benchmark or device operations. CI runs them once in the
Ubuntu workflow job; existing platform/version jobs and tests remain required.
Hosted setup installs Ubuntu's `bubblewrap` and `apparmor-profiles` packages,
then loads `/usr/share/apparmor/extra-profiles/bwrap-userns-restrict` and checks
namespace startup before running the tests. It does not disable
AppArmor or change a global namespace restriction. A host that cannot create the
required namespaces fails this check rather than running the hook unconfined.

The separate measurement command is `python3 -B scripts/performance/linux_hook.py --output <new-directory>`. Its default runs three repeats of 1,000 samples for
each of the 1/10/50-session Linux profiles. Use it only for authorized measurement
work. It retains failed repetitions and rejects existing output directories.
The namespace mounts only read-only system runtimes and pinned source, new
Linux state and temporary files. Parent timeout kills the namespace and the
host terminates and verifies its own namespace init through a Linux PID handle;
Linux then terminates every namespace member. No personal
configuration, Windows metadata, client sessions or physical endpoints are used.
