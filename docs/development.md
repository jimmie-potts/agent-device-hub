# Development setup

## Bootstrap commands

Use Node 24 and npm from the assigned worktree root:

```bash
npm ci
npm run check:workflow
npm run test:workflow
```

Both checks must exit zero. The current specification inventory is zero
capabilities, zero active changes and zero archived changes. That is a valid
bootstrap, not an implemented behavior baseline.

OpenSpec 1.12.0 is pinned locally. Use npm run openspec -- <arguments>. Its wrapper
isolates configuration and suppresses telemetry/completion migration. Initialize
using init --tools none --profile core --no-animation. Do not generate local
skill integrations or run a global OpenSpec installation.

For a WSL sandbox with a read-only npm cache, use a writable temporary cache.
Keep dependency caches, browser binaries and all runtime state outside source.

GitHub CI runs Workflow checks on ubuntu-latest and windows-latest. Both execute
npm ci and the two workflow commands. Product tests/build/type/browser checks
must be introduced with their implementing issues and become required jobs;
these bootstrap checks do not validate agent or device behavior.

## Shared tooling provenance

The bootstrap wrapper, validator and fixtures adapt the existing Pixoo tooling
at revision 4fd259b08ff22dcf73938162f7dff67b71d23ed9. They preserve its CLI and
configuration-isolation behavior. This temporary bootstrap copy is recorded;
[agent-device-hub#10](https://github.com/jimmie-potts/agent-device-hub/issues/10) owns publishing the common package, and [divoom-app-upgrade#38](https://github.com/jimmie-potts/divoom-app-upgrade/issues/38) and
[codex-nanoleaf#31](https://github.com/jimmie-potts/codex-nanoleaf/issues/31) own replacing the device copies. No shared skill is vendored.

## Agent setup

Use the reviewed [agent-skills catalog](https://github.com/jimmie-potts/agent-skills)
outside this checkout. The workflow uses github-delivery, code-review, tdd,
grill-with-docs, grilling, domain-modeling, writing-for-agents, unslop and the
OpenSpec propose/explore/apply/update/sync/archive skills.

Inspect installed paths first. Provision only missing skills through the catalog
manager when the user authorizes personal setup; preserve conflicts and the source
checkout supporting installed links. Do not copy methods or external symlinks here.

Codex reads root AGENTS.md; Claude reads CLAUDE.md, which imports @AGENTS.md.
[Codex discovery](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/agent-configuration/agents-md)
and [Claude imports](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory#agentsmd) define those
mechanisms. Links to docs are conditional read instructions, not automatic imports.

Verify actual discovery in a fresh authorized host session before claiming
host compatibility. A filesystem link, static instruction exercise or CI pass
alone does not establish live Codex/Claude loading or lifecycle events. Check
root and any future nested launch directory independently.

Keep personal Claude/Codex settings, authentication, trust, hook files and runtime
data outside the repository. One branch/worktree and coordinating writer owns each
active deliverable; shared Git operations and installations still need ownership.

## Future package and controller validation

[agent-device-hub#2](https://github.com/jimmie-potts/agent-device-hub/issues/2) owns provider qualification; [agent-device-hub#4](https://github.com/jimmie-potts/agent-device-hub/issues/4) owns the device
contract and cross-language fixtures. [agent-device-hub#3](https://github.com/jimmie-potts/agent-device-hub/issues/3) owns reusable core/package
tests. Consumer changes must run those fixtures against supported contract
versions without private metadata or a physical device.

Define versioned artifacts and a compatibility matrix before a second repository
depends on an exported package. Never import a package from another developer's
checkout path. Changes to shared contracts must validate every affected consumer.

Installation and physical testing follow docs/sdlc.md and the owning device guide.
No bootstrap command installs the app, changes hooks, reads live device credentials
or sends device requests.
